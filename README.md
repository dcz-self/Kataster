# Breedmatic

An experiment with evolving creatures.

The creatures breed and try to flood you. Whoever survives before being shot or eaten is allowed to breed again.

Based on [Kataster](https://github.com/Bobox214/Kataster).

Inspired by the unmatched freeware version of [Crimsonland](http://phoenix.ee/old-crimsonland-1-02-1-3-0-1-4-0/).

## Breeding

Get assets from https://porcupinefactory.org/data/assets.zip and unpack them into the `assets` directory.

Then you can start the breeding process:

```
cargo run --release
```

Both the shooters and the fleas will start breeding. Fleas are pre-seeded, so they will not get much smarter.

But the shootersâ€¦ They start out uncoordinated. As they mutate, and as fleas take away the dumbest, only the high scoring one will remain in the gene pool.

After about 100 attempts, the gene pool will get honed, and you should be seeing good shooters regularly.

## Neurons

Brains of all creatures are neural networks, and the connections between neurons, and neurons' activation funcions are what evolves.

### Open brain (disabled for memory leaks :()

The bottom left corner is the live view of the brain of the shooter.

The brain takes in signals from the two topmost circles: angle to nearest baddie, time alive. The signal passes along connections from top to bottom to neurons, and the final circles-neurons at the bottom result in the output signals: angle of the weapon, body turn rate, and movement speed.

Signal strength is expressed with color: gray means relaxed (0), yellow active (positive), blue negative. The stronger the signal is, the stronger the color.

Some connections have no circle at the top: those are "bias" connections. The source strength is always 1.

### Neuron anatomy

Every neuron's task is to sum up incoming signals, and then to activate based on the result. Most neurons activate proportionally, but there is also the sigmoid activation (result never exceeds [0, 1]), the step (anything below 0 turns into 0, anything above activates to 1), ReLU (anything below 0 is shunted to 0), and Gaussian (the farther the sum from 0, the farther the activation from 1).

So don't be surprised that a neuron with no connections is suddenly always active!

## FAQ

### It's slow!

Yes. Let me know you care and I may fix it.

### Interpreting the text

Each round, some text will print on the console, informing about the current evolution. It looks like this:

```
Spawn offspring of 87
Spawned genotype Mut 20
Hidden
    Linear: -0.953 0.001 0.001 
    Linear: 0.000 -0.054 0.011 
    Gaussian: 0.000 0.070 0.687 
Out
    Linear: -0.853 0.000 -0.361 0.000 
    Linear: 0.000 -0.720 0.000 0.000 
    Step01: 0.000 1.190 0.000 0.000 

Wrote shooter.dot
Preserved as 90 with score 720
Pop 22
```

Let's break it down.

```
Spawn offspring of 87
```

Each shooter in the gene pool gets a unique number. This shows the number(s) of the parent(s) of the just-spawned shooter.

```
Spawned genotype Mut 20
```

The shooter went through 20 mutations. Mutations will happen more often when population is low.

```
Hidden
    Linear: -0.953 0.001 0.001 
    Linear: 0.000 -0.054 0.011 
    Gaussian: 0.000 0.070 0.687 
```

The hidden layer of neurons in the brain (rows). Inputs are: angle to baddie, time alive, bias (columns).

```
Out
    Linear: -0.853 0.000 -0.361 0.000 
    Linear: 0.000 -0.720 0.000 0.000 
    Step01: 0.000 1.190 0.000 0.000 
```

The output layer. Inputs come from the previous layer of neurons, plus an extra bias comes last (columns). Outputs are rows: weapon angle relative to movement direction, body turn speed, walk speed.

```
Wrote shooter.dot
```

The shooter was saved as a file for graphviz. Convert it to png using:

```
dot shooter.dot -Tpng -oshooter.png
```

Next comes the notice about shooter's death.

```
Preserved as 90 with score 720
Pop 22
```

The shooter's ID in the gene pool is 90 in this case, resulting in 22 different genotypes in the pool.
